# TODO
## an informal roadmap of features to be added
* add hit points column
    * when line is active, hitting up and down arrow keys will increase or lower HP
    * auto-disable when they reach 0 HP
* add data export so it can be saved or moved elsewhere
* add data import to load data from an export
