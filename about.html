    <h1>about Do Rounds</h1>
    <h2>so...what is this thing, anyway?</h2>
    <p>
        Do Rounds is a tool that I developed after a weekend of Tabletop Roleplaying with
        my friends. We were playing Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, and I was the Dungeon
        Master. I had put together an adventure that had several very large encounters
        between the players and monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that I was spending great amounts of time managing the details of the
        combat using pen and paper. It was time-consuming and error-prone, and it raised
        my programmer hackles; why was I doing all of this on paper when I could easily
        envision a simple application that would handle all of the tedious parts for me?
    </p>
    <p>
        Three days later, here it is. Simple, to-the-point, and functional. Just the way
        that I like things.
    </p>
    <h2>is this free?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes, it is 100% free from any obligation to the user.
    </p>
    <h2>what about privacy?</h2>
    <p>
        I'm glad that you asked. I purposefully built this application such that -- to the best
        of my knowledge -- it contains zero infringements on the privacy of those who use it.
        There are no logins. All of the user's data is stored in the browser, on their computer.
        There are no cookies of any kind. Nothing that you do here is tracked in any way. The server
        doesn't log IP addresses.
        The application makes no network connections other than to load its CSS and JS files 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are no ads. I just don't care about making money off of this, and it costs me
        next to nothing to run.
    </p>
    <h2>is it open source?</h2>
    <p>
        It certainly is. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/adamcrossland/dorounds">repo</a> on GitHub. It is UnLicensed. Fork it,
        make changes, host it yourself; it's all good as far as I am concerned.
    </p>
    <h2>does it use any external libraries?</h2>
    <p>
        Yes. It uses <a href="https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html">Spectre.css</a>
        as well as <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>how can i make suggestions for improvement or report bugs?</h2>
    <p>
        The best way is to <a href="https://github.com/adamcrossland/dorounds/issues">raise an issue on github,</a>
        but you could also send me an email: adam at adamcrossland dot net.
