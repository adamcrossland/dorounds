    <h1>Do Rounds Tutorial</h1>
    <p>
        This page will give you a step-by-step tour through using <b>Do Rounds</b>
        to manage your D&D 5e encounters.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting Out</h2>
    <p>
        The first thing that you should notice is the Encounter List.
        It will show all of the encounters that you have defined and allow
        you to switch between them. Note that there is always an encounter 
        called 'New...' which you can edit and change the name of.
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/encounter_list.png" alt="the top-most part of the Do Rounds main page, with the Encounter List selection box highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Do Rounds Encounter List</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        To change the name to something useful &mdash; or to rename an existing
        encounter &mdash; click the 'Edit' button and set the name to what you like.
        Then, hit the Enter key to save your change.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's create an Encounter called 'Players.' Here, we will record the player 
        characters: Joe, who has 34 HP, 14 AC and +4 to hit; Tom, who has 38 HP, 16 AC,
        +4 to hit; Paul, who has 40 HP, 16 AC and +4 to hit, and Maryanne, who has 30 HP,
        14 AC and +4 to hit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enter Joe's information, then hit the + button, which will add a new, blank line below:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/players_first_line.png" alt="One line filled in, with the plus button highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Adding players to the encounter</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Repeat the process for the remaining players:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/players_filled_out.png" alt="Four lines filled in">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">All players added to the encounter</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, hit your browser's Reload button. Yes, really, try it. You'll see that all of your 
        data is still there. <b>Do Rounds</b> automatically saves your data at every change, 
        so you will never need to worry about losing work because you forgot to save.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, let's create an encounter with some monsters for our players to battle. Since we 
        will not want to have to add the player information again, let's make a new encounter 
        by copying this one. Hit the downward-pointing arrow button that is next to the 
        Encounter List:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/encounter_clone_button.png" alt="The Encounter Clone button, highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Encounter Clone button</figcaption>
        </figure>
        This is the Encounter Clone button, and it will make a new copy of the currently 
        selected Encoutner with a new name:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/copy_of_encounter.png" alt="The Encounter List select box is open, showing a new Encounter called Copy of Players">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A copy of the Encounter called 'Players'</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Select the new encounter, and rename it to 'Goblin Clan Battle.' Now, we need to add 
        some monsters to the Encounter. Press the plus button on the last line to get a new,
        blank line, and add Goblin 1, who has 10 HP, 12 AC and +4 to hit. Next, instead of
        hitting the plus button to get a new blank line, try hitting the downward-pointing 
        arrow on that line.
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/first_creature_added.png" alt="A line filled out with information about Goblin 1, with the Clone to New Line button highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">There are always goblins</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Like the similar icon above, this button will clone the current line,
        saving you from doing extra typing. Hit the CLone to New Line button again, and 
        now you have three Goblins, ready to go:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/three_goblins.png" alt="Three new lines for three different Goblins">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Goblins...goblins everywhere</figcaption>
        </figure>
        You'll notice that you did not have to rename the two cloned Goblins; since it is very
        common for encounters to have more than one instance of common types of monsters,
        <b>Do Roll</b> will automatically increment any number that it finds at the end of
        a name.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it is time to play out the encounter, you'll have the players roll d20s for their
        initiative scores. Let's say that Joe got 11, Tom 13, Paul 16 and Maryanne 8. If you would
        like to save yourself the time and tedium of rolling and entering the goblins' initiative scores,
        just hit the 'Auto-roll' button, and any remaining blank initiative scores will be filled
        in for you:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/gcb_all_filled_in.png" alt="Four players and three monsters">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">All lines are ready to go</figcaption>
        </figure>
        One last step before we start the encounter: it is definitely preferable to have the 
        participants in order of descending initiative score. Hit the button with an up and
        down arrow, the 'Sort Lines' button, and the list will be sorted for you:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/sort_button.png" alt="The Sort Lines button, highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Sort Lines button</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Now, your encounter is all ready to begin play:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/ready_to_go.png" alt="A grid of seven enounter participants, sorted from highest to lowest initiative score">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Sorted and ready to play</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <h2>Playing the encounter</h2>
    <p>
        To begin playing the encounter, hit the 'Start' button:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/start_button.png" alt="The Start button, highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Press this when it is time to fight</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will notice that some elements on the page change. The text 'Round 1' appears on the
        top line. The number will increase as you step through all of the encounter's 
        participants. Also, a left-facing arrow will appear along the right side of the grid
        to indicate which player currently has their turn. Finally, each line has an X button 
        at the end; pressing it will indicate that the participant is no longer able to take turns,
        being dead or unconcious:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/playing_1.png" alt="In Play mode, with the round number, current turn indicator and disabled button highlighted">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Encounter in Play mode</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can press the spacebar to move from the current participant to the next, and 
        after you get to the last one, the Round number will increment, and play will 
        return to the top of the list. If any participants are disable, they will be skipped over.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to change the number of 
        hit points that the currently participant has. On the first line, hit the down arrow 
        five times, indicating that Paul has taken 5 points of damage:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/five_damage.png" alt="The hit points column is highlighted and is now five fewer than before">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Damage taken</figcaption>
        </figure>
        Of course, you can always diretly manipulate the value in the HP field &mdesh; by
        typing in a number or using the up and down arrows in the field &mdash; at any time,
        regardless of whose turn it currently is.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can revise the Round number by clicking the pencil icon. Change the number
        to what it ought to be and the hit Enter:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/edit_round.png" alt="Changing the Round number by clicking on the pencil icon">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Modify the Round number</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, you can delete an Encounter with the trash can icon:
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="img-responsive" src="images/delete_encounter.png" alt="You can delete and encounter with the trash can icon">
            <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Delete an Encounter</figcaption>
        </figure>
